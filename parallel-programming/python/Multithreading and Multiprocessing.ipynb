    "The [Producer-Consumer Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Producer%E2%80%93consumer_problem) is a standard computer science problem used to look at threading or process synchronization issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a program that needs to read messages from a network and write them to disk. The program does not request a message when it wants. It must be listening and accept messages as they come in. The messages will not come in at a regular pace, but will be coming in bursts. This part of the program is called the __producer__.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other side, once you have a message, you need to write it to a database. The database access is slow, but fast enough to keep up to the average pace of messages. It is not fast enough to keep up when a burst of messages comes in. This part is the __consumer__.\n",
    "\n",
    "Producer and consumer communicate through a __pipeline__, which can be implemented in multiple ways. If you want to be able to handle more than one value in the pipeline at a time, you’ll need a data structure for the pipeline that allows the number to grow and shrink as data backs up from the producer. The best fit for this is a `Queue`, provided by Python with the `queue` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the implementation we present makes use of the `threading.Event` object. This allows one thread to signal an event while many other threads can be waiting for that event to happen. The key usage in this code is that the threads that are waiting for the event do not necessarily need to stop what they are doing, they can just check the status of the Event every once in a while."
